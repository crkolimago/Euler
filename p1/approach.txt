Find the sum of all the multiuples of 3 or 5 below n (1000)

Ex. n = 10; sum = 3+5+6+9 = 23

Step 1: If n is a multiple of 3 or 5, decrement by 1 (this will come in handy later)
Step 2: Find the sum of all multiples of 3
- First compute n/3. This is the number of factors of 3 less than n
- Next take the Gauss summation of these factors. For example if n/3 = 2, this means there 
are 2 factors which will be 3 and 6.
- Finally, multiple the Gauss sum by 3. Since the factors increase evenly by 3 each time
this allows us to compute the sum of these factors such that [3+6]=[3(1+2)].
Step 3: Do the same as step 2 but using 5 instead of 3
Step 4: Do the same as step 2 but using 15 instead of 3
Step 5: The final sum will be the sum of the factors of 3 + the sum of the factors of 5 - 
the sum of the factors of 15 (this will allows us to handle repeats)

The sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000, divisible by 3 and 5 is: 233168
